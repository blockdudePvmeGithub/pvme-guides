**__Location and How to Get There__**
Venomous Dinosaurs are located on the northwestern part of Anachronia. The easiest way to get there is Anachronia Teleport to a Totem of the Abyss at the north totem pedestal. An alternative method is to lodestone teleport to Anachronia (keyboard shortcut "Alt + D"), use the Orthen teleportation device to Outpost (keyboard shortcut "O"), and run west.

**__Useful Items__**
⬥ **Restocking Cannon Ability** - Allows the cannon to restock without requiring interaction.

.
⬥ **Alloy Spikes** <:armourspike:756235792053174332> - Very strong here, allowing for increased poison hits and healing via the usage of a scrimshaw of Vampyrism <:VampScrim:513201294262009874>. Regular armour spikes are acceptable as well.

.
⬥ **Essence of Finality** <:eofor:745279787471470713> with an **Annihilation** <:annihilation:796989662983094275> stored inside - Provides a 1% damage boost for 30s per stack, capping at 20 stacks.

.
**__Method__**
⬥ Venomous Dinosaurs hit with melee auto-attacks. To prevent taking too much damage, the Enhanced Devoted <:enhdev4:712073087507628035> perks is helpful for survivability, as you will be praying <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300>.

.
⬥ If using the Corbicula Rex perk from the Ranch out of Time, excess adrenaline can be used in the form of the <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> or <:annihilation:796989662983094275> <:eofor:745279787471470713>, both of these can be rotated between to greatly increase the damage dealt.

**__Preset Notes__**
⬥ Notepaper is used to note dinosuars bones. Can be replaced by Death Note relic power.
    • If not using Death Note relic power, a demon horn necklace can be used in conjunction with bonecrusher to gain prayer points. Due to the value of dinosuar bones, this is not recommended but can be used for some prayer points during a task.
⬥ More than 1 dose of Weapon Poison +++ <:weppoison:689525476158472288> may be required.
⬥ Runes are only needed if using Anachronia Teleport spell.
⬥ EoF contains Annihilation for special attack.
